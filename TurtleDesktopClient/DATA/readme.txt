The data folder contains two folders: ORGANIZED and RAW. ORGANIZED contains all data that has been processed from the raw files.
Data from ORGANIZED is ready for R graph representation, and graphs are also stored in this folder directory in the same location
as the processed data file. The RAW folder contains the raw data text files taken from each terminal arduino unit.
